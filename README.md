# Tish
Tish is a C++ implementation of a command line interface program. I wrote it in my fall semester of Translyvania University. The project stands for Transy Interactive Shell. The idea of the project is that it will act as an extension of the CLI. Users can run the Tish program and then have access to all new commands from the terminal. For example, when Tish is running, the user will see ">:" indicating that Tish is awaiting input from the user. Some Tish commands are dependent on the Proc file system meaning they will only work on certain systems. Which commands are dependent on the Proc file system is explained below. If the user types a command into Tish that is not programmed into the system, Tish will attempt to fork and exec the command and run it from the shell normally on the system. This is important because it means users can run all commands programmed into Tish along with all other programs that are in the command line interface by default.
